# (Deprecated) Integration Documentation

Click here for the  - [Updated Integration Documentation](https://tsbmediaventure.github.io/developer-docs/)

# Getting Started

Welcome to ConsCent! This documentation covers all the steps for you to get set up - from optionally registering your premium stories with ConsCent which are priced for a Pay per View basis, followed by integrating the paywall on your story pages and initialising the overlay to ensure all premium content is paid for.

You can get started by following the steps mentioned on the [Using ConsCent Page](#using-conscent).

# Registration

The first step is registering your client with ConsCent. This is done by the ConsCent Team internally and your administrator will recieve the login credenitals (email & password) for the ConsCent Client Dashboard on the email they chose to register with. The client must provide a default value for the 'price', 'duration' and optionally geolocation overrides if the client wants geo-fenced pricing options. This will ensure that all the premium content on the clients website/app is micro-priced - even if the client doesn't register the content with ConsCent via API. (Price values are in INR)

By logging in to your ConsCent Client Dashboard and navigating to the [Integrations Page](https://ConsCent.vercel.app/client/dashboard/integration). You will be able to view your active ClientId, API Key and API Secret.

# Using ConsCent

- In order to start creating stories on ConsCent you need to ensure you follow the [Authentication Guidelines](#authentication). ConsCent will only allow authorised clients to create, view and edit stories. For using these client APIs, the Client API Key and Secret must be passed in Authorization Headers using Basic Auth. With API Key as the Username and API Secret as the password.

Whenever you're utilising the Web Integration Code or Calling any ConsCent APIs - you need to update the API_URL and SDK_URL variables based on the environment you're operating in.

<ul class = 'instruction-bg-url'>
  <li>
    Sandbox Environment: 
    <ul>
      <li>API_URL:  https://sandbox-api.conscent.in</li>
      <li>SDK_URL:  https://sandbox-sdk.conscent.in</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul class = 'instruction-bg-url'>
  <li>
    Production Environment: 
    <ul>
      <li>API_URL:  https://api.conscent.in</li>
      <li>SDK_URL:  https://sdk.conscent.in</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

- If you wish to ONLY use blanket pricing - which allows you to set all your premium stories at the same default price and priceOverrides with which your client is registered - you can skip the registering/editing stories steps and move on to integrating the paywall on all your premium content pages.

- Any content that you don't register with ConsCent will be priced using the Blanket Pricing parameters - which are determined when the client is registered.

- Now you can start registering your premium content stories with ConsCent! Call the [Create Story API](#create-story) for any story that you wish to register with ConsCent.

Once you have registered your stories on ConsCent, you need to integrate the paywall on all your Premium Content Pages.

- Follow the steps in the [Web Integration Section](#web-integration) to add the ConsCent paywall to all the premium story pages on your website.

<!-- - Additionally, Follow the steps in the [React Native Integration Section](#react-native-integration) to add the ConsCent paywall to all the premium story pages on your Android/iOS application. -->

Ensuring that the paywall appears each time a premium story is opened, as well as allowing users to purchase stories via ConsCent.

- Next, you need to call the [Validate Story Read API](#validate-story-read) using the recieved "readId" in the successCallback response, when a user purchases the client's story via ConsCent - which will assist the client in authenticating valid and unique transactions on their stories.

Integrating the paywall allows the users to purchase the Client's Stories via ConsCent at Micropriced rates. The Web Integration section includes the steps involved in handling the Success and Failure Callbacks after the users go through the ConsCent Paywall, followed by validating each unique transaction incurred by a user on the any of the Clients Stories.

- To view a list of all the client's stories registered on ConsCent you can call the [View All Stories API](#view-all-stories).

- To view the details of an individual client story you can call the [View Story Details API](#view-story-details).

- To edit any story registered with ConsCent you can call [Edit Story API](#edit-story).

# Web Integration

> ConsCent Paywall Initalisation Script:

```
<script>
  const clientId = '5f92a62013332e0f667794dc';
  (function (w, d, s, o, f, cid) {
    if (!w[o]) {
      w[o] = function () {
        w[o].q.push(arguments);
      };
      w[o].q = [];
    }
    (js = d.createElement(s)), (fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]);
    js.id = o;
    js.src = f;
    js.async = 1;
    js.title = cid;
    fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
  })(window, document, 'script', '_csc', {SDK_URL}, clientId);
</script>
```

> Ensure you replace the 'clientId' with your actual Client ID retrieved from the Conscent Client Dashboard Integration Page and the {SDK_URL} with the sdk url of an environment you want to use, e.g. 'https://sandbox-sdk.conscent.in' for sandbox

Integrating ConsCent on your Website is a simple and direct process. You start by copying the code on the right hand side within the script tags - and adding it to the header section of your Route Index file.

You can get your ConsCent Client Id from the [Client Integrations Page](https://ConsCent.vercel.app/client/dashboard/integration) of the ConsCent Client Dashboard - as mentioned in the [Registration Section](#registration).

<p class = 'instruction-bg'>Including this code in the header section allows the ConsCent Paywall to be initalised and further used whenever required on a Premium Content Page. </p>

<p class = 'instruction-bg'>Finally, In order to ensure the the ConsCent Paywall appears on all Story Pages which contain Premium Content. You need to implement the following function on the story page - included on the right hand side - which calls the initalisation function '_csc' of the ConsCent Paywall and enables a user to purchase the particular premium story at a Micropriced value through ConsCent. Please ensure that you call this function anytime you want the ConsCent paywall to show up on your story page and that you have filtered for users that have subscribed to your platform beforehand and already have access to view the content and thus will not be going through the ConsCent paywall. </p>

> Include ConsCent Paywall on Premium Content Story Page:

```
const csc = window._csc;
csc('init', {
  debug: true, // can be set to false to remove sdk non-error log output
  storyId: storyId,
  subscriptionUrl: {clientSubscriptionUrl},
  signInUrl: {clientSignInUrl},
  clientId: clientId,
  title: storyTitle,
  isMobile: 'false',
  successCallback: yourSuccessCallbackFunction,
  wrappingElementId: 'csc-paywall',
  fullScreenMode: 'false', // if set to true, the entire screen will be covered
})
```

> Success Callback example:

```
async function yourSuccessCallbackFunction(validationObject: any) {
  // Function to show the premium content to the User since they have paid for it via ConsCent
  // Here you should verify the  validationObject with our backend
  // And then you must show the user the complete story

  // example verification code:
  console.log('Initiating verification with conscent backend');
  const xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest(); // using vanilla javascript to make a post request
  const url = `${API_URL}/api/v1/story/read/${validationObject.readId}`;
  xhttp.open('POST', url, true);
  // e is the response event
  xhttp.onload = (e) => {
    const backendConfirmationData = JSON.parse(e.target.response);

    // verifying that the validation received matches the backend data
    if (
      validationObject.readId === backendConfirmationData.readId &&
      validationObject.payloadclientId === backendConfirmationData.payload.clientId &&
      validationObject.payload.storyId === backendConfirmationData.payload.storyId
    ) {
      // Validation successful
      console.log('successful validation');
      // showStory would be your function that will do all the actions that need to be done to show the whole story
      showStory(true);
    }
  };
  xhttp.send();
}
```

We import the initalisation script using the unique '\_csc' identifier and run the 'init' function by passing a number of parameters:

- The 'clientId' which is retrieved from the [Client Integrations Page](https://ConsCent.vercel.app/client/dashboard/integration) of the ConsCent Client Dashboard.

- The 'storyId' which should be identical to the Story Id by which the particular story is registered with in the Client CMS. This allows us to identify each unique story for a client.

- The 'title' which should be the Story Title by which the particular story is registered with in the Client CMS.

- The 'subscriptionUrl' which is the link to the Subscription page of the clients website - in cases when a user would like to subscribe to the clients website for viewing the premium content offered.

- You can optionally provide the 'signInUrl' which is the link to the login page for already subscribed users on the clients platform - in cases when a user has already registered and paid for the clients subscription and would like to access premium content using their login credentials. Doing this will add a "Sign in here" text to be displayed below the "Subscribe" button.

- 'wrappingElementId' is a mandatory string which is the id of an element (e.g. a div with absolute positioning on your website) within which you want the paywall to be embedded. Your element should have a minimum width of 320 pixels and a minimum height of 550 pixels for the conscent paywall to fit properly.

- 'fullScreenMode' can be set to 'true' or 'false' (strings) -- if true, the first screen of the paywall will cover the entire webpage. This is useful if you don't want the page to be visible at all.

 <p class = 'instruction-bg'>Once the ConsCent Paywall has been initalised and the User has gone through the necessary steps needed to purchase the story via ConsCent - you need to implement a 'successCallback' function which will recieve a response containing a validationObject shown below - indicating whether the user has purchased the story, or if the user has access to the story already since they have purchased it before, or whether the transaction has failed and the user has not purchased the story. </p>

<code> 
{
    "message": "Story Purchased Successfully",
    "payload": {
        "clientId": "5fbb40b07dd98b0e89d90a25",
        "storyId": "Client Story Id 5",
        "createdAt": "2020-12-29T05:51:31.116Z"
    },
    "readId": "a0c433af-a413-49e1-9f40-ce1fbd63f568",
    "signature": "74h9xm2479m7x792nxx247998975393x08y9hubrufyfy3348oqpqqpyg78fhfurifr3",
}
</code>

The message "Story Purchased Successfully" appears in the response only when the user has purchased a story via ConsCent and the "accessTimeLeft" field appears in the response only when the user has purchased this story previously and still has free access to view the content. Moreover, the response contains a "readId" field which will be used to verify each unique transaction by a user on the clients stories with ConsCent.

Calling the [Validate Story Read](#validate-story-read) API using the recieved "readId" in the successCallback response can assist the client in authenticating valid and unique transactions on their stories.

<p class = 'instruction-bg'>The response validationObject from the 'Validate Story Read' API includes the same fields as mentioned in the validationObject above and matching the payload from the 'successCallback' response and 'Validate Story Read' response allows the client to ensure each transaction of premium content stories via ConsCent is validated by matching the clientId, storyId, and createdAt (Date of Read/Transaction); </p>
 
If the case arrives when the user tries to purchase a story via ConsCent on the client's website and the transaction fails. The client can handle that case as well in a 'failedCallback' function or redirect to any page - as the Client wishes.

Lastly, once the transaction has been validated by the Client - whether they choose to do it in the frontend or the backend - the client needs to show the premium content purchased by the User. You can do this on the same page, or redirect the user to a different page containing the full content of the premium story.

<!-- # React Native Integration

This section covers integrating the ConsCent paywall into your react native application. This works for both iOS and Android.

You start by including ConsCent's React Native plugin. Using the following command

<p class = 'instruction-bg'>
npm i -s react-native-conscent
</p>

This is a package written in react-native with no native code - it is a pure javascript implementation and can be used in both iOS and Android applications with no extra configuration.

> Include ConsCent Paywall on Premium Content Story Page of your Android/iOS Application:

```
import Conscent from 'react-native-conscent';

export default function App() {
  return (
    // When you want to render conscent's paywall, simply use the Conscent component
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Conscent
        clientId="your-client-id"
        storyId="your-story-id"
        successCallback={successCallback}
        subscriptionUrl="https://www.yoursite.com/yourstory"
        signInUrl="https://www.yoursite.com/login"
        subscriptionCallback={subscriptioncallback}
        mode="sandbox"
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

You can get your ConsCent Client Id from the [Client Integrations Page](https://ConsCent.vercel.app/client/dashboard/integration) of the ConsCent Client Dashboard - as mentioned in the [Registration Section](#registration).

<p class = 'function-params'> Function Parameters </p>

| successCallback      | Function which will receive the success payload. See the success payload structure below.                                                                       |
| subscriptionUrl      | You may either set the subscriptionUrl or the subscriptionCallback. subscriptionUrl will open the given url in the browser when the subscribe button is clicked |
| signInUrl      | You can optionally provide the link to the login page for already subscribed users on the clients platform - in cases when a previously subscribed user would like to access premium content using their login credentials. Doing this will add a "Sign in here" text to be displayed below the "Subscribe" button. |
| subscriptionCallback | function which receives no arguments. This function is called when the user clicks the subscribe button                                                         |
| mode                 | either 'sandbox' or 'production' based on your credentials                                                                                                      |

In order to show the ConsCent paywall before your premium content, you need to include the &lt;Conscent &gt; component with the required props. Usually, you would like to show the paywall before your registered premium stories to users who haven't subscribed to your service.

<p class = 'instruction-bg'>An example of how to initiate the paywall is show on the right-hand side. Include the &lt;Conscent &gt; component with the required props.</p>

Once the ConsCent Paywall has been initalised and the User has gone through the necessary steps needed to purchase the story via ConsCent - the 'successCallback' function you have provided as a prop will be called containing an object shown below - indicating whether the user has purchased the story, or if the user has access to the story already since they have purchased it before recently.

Additionally, you must set either the Subscription URL or the Subscription Callback function to determine the what happens when the user clicks on the 'Subscribe' button present on the conscent paywall and instead of paying per view.

<code> 
{
    "message": "Story Purchased Successfully",
    "payload": {
        "clientId": "5fbb40b07dd98b0e89d90a25",
        "storyId": "Client Story Id 5",
        "transactionAmount": 5,
        "earningAmount": 4,
        "createdAt": "2020-12-29T05:51:31.116Z"
    },
    "readId": "a0c433af-a413-49e1-9f40-ce1fbd63f568",
}
</code>

The message "Story Purchased Successfully" appears in the response only when the user has purchased a story via ConsCent and the "accessTimeLeft" field appears in the response only when the user has purchased this story previously and still has free access to view the content. Moreover, the response contains a "readId" field which can be used to verify each unique transaction by a user on the clients registered stories on ConsCent. Moreover, the payload contains the 'transactionAmount' that the user pays for the story as well as the 'earningAmount' that the client earns for each of their stories that a user purchases through ConsCent.

Call the [Validate Story Read](#validate-story-read) API using the recieved "readId" in the successCallback response to verify that the transaction was unique and valid. The validate story read endpoint can only be used once per readId to ensure authenticity. Basically, readId functions as a one-time token.

<p class = 'instruction-bg'>The response payload from the 'Validate Story Read' API includes the same fields as mentioned in the payload above and matching the payload from the 'successCallback' response and 'Validate Story Read' response allows the client to ensure each transaction of premium content stories via ConsCent is validated by matching the clientId, storyId, transactionAmount and createdAt(Date of Read/Transaction); </p>

<p class='instruction-bg'>If any field  received in the success callback payload doesn't match the backend data, it is a fraudulent transaction & access to the premium content must not be provided</p>
 
Lastly, once the transaction has been validated by the Client - whether they choose to do it in the frontend or the backend - the client needs to show the premium content purchased by the User. You can do this on the same screen, or in another screencontaining the full content of the premium story. In the screen where you show the premium content, you MUST also show the ConsCent floating action button, you can do this by including the &lt;Conscent.Fab&gt; component anywhere in your view.

<p class='instruction-bg'>The ConsCent floating action button must be visible when displaying your premium content that is priced on ConsCent. Do so by  including the &lt;Conscent.Fab&gt; component anywhere in your view</p> -->

# API Introduction

Welcome to the ConsCent Client API! You can use our APIs to access ConsCent Client API endpoints, which can help you get information on various tasks such as how to create stories, verify story payment etc.

We have language bindings in Shell (cURL), PHP, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Authentication

ConsCent uses API keys to allow access to the API for the Client to Create and Register a Story with ConsCent. You can view your API Key and Secret by logging in to your ConsCent Client Dashboard and navigating to the Integrations Page [Client Integrations Page](https://ConsCent.vercel.app/client/dashboard/integration). Please contact your administrator for the Login Credentials to access the ConsCent Client Dashboard - provided on the official email address registered with ConsCent.

ConsCent expects for the API Key and Secret to be included as Basic Authentication in certain API requests (Create Story API utilised by the Client).

`Authorization: Basic RDZXN1Y4US1NTkc0V1lDLVFYOUJQMkItOEU3QjZLRzpUNFNHSjlISDQ3TVpRWkdTWkVGVjZYUk5TS1E4RDZXN1Y4UU1ORzRXWUNRWDlCUDJCOEU3QjZLRw==`

This endpoint allows the Client to Register their Story on ConsCent - with the Story Title, StoryId, Story URL, Price as well as any specific Price Overrides for a country - In order to set a different price for the story in the relevant country. Moreover, the Client can also set the duration of a story - which means that if a story if purchased by a User on ConsCent, then that User can have free access to the story for {duration} amount of time. By Default we user a 1 Day duration. Lastly, the price & priceOverrides of the story can only be set as a distinct value chosen by the client - which can be any out of [0, 0.01, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10]. These prices are in INR and ONLY these values can be set as the price of the story - otherwise the API call for creating a story will throw a 400 (Bad Request) Error.
